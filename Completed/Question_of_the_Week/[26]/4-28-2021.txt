How would you get executives to approve your cybersecurity budget request? What do you think executives should consider?


I do not have enough experience to give a realistic and pragmatic answer. From what I’ve seen in my studies, the answer to these questions is divided into three categories: 
Businesses should treat Cybersecurity as an insurance policy
Leaders should focus on ROI vs risk with Cybersecurity
Leaders should focus on how Cybersecurity will impact the front and back, totality of the business and the business’s customers 


In camp 1, this is about showing leadership the risk of not making an investment in cybersecurity.
In camp 2, this is about weighing whether a cybersecurity team or solution cost will be made back or not.
In camp 3, this is about not taking a fear based approach, but a program approach to show value.


I hope to get more experience to better answer this. What is very clear to me, is that there are a lot of solutions to try and reach the same goal. So, maybe the answer is more of a tool belt situation, where you try until you find what works best, for those leaders and that business.
