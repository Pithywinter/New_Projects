- Define a Man-in-the-Browser attack, how an attacker carries it out, who it affects most, and the mitigation strategy needed.


A Man-in-the-Browser attack is an internet threat, related to the Man-in-the-Middle cyber attack in that it intercepts & manipulates calls between the browser & its security mechanisms or libraries-on-the fly, where a Trojan Horse is the proxy that infects a web browser by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in browser security to modify web pages, modify transaction content, or insert additional transactions all secretly invisible to both the user & host web application. This attack will be successful regardless of whether security mechanisms such as Secure Sockets Layer/ Public Key Infrastructure and two- or three-factor authentication solutions are in place. 


Related attacks: Man-in-the-Middle, Man-in-the-Mobile malware, & Boy-in-the-Browser.


How it is done: 
* The attacker deploys a Trojan that infects the computer software, either OS or Application.
* The Trojan then installs an extension into the browser configuration, so that it will be loaded the next time the browser starts.
* Some time later, the user restarts the browser.
* The browser loads the extension, and the extension registers a handler for every page-load.
* Whenever a page loads, the URL of the page is searched by the extension against a list of known sites targeted for attack.
* The user logs in securely.
* When the handler detects a page-load for a specific pattern in its targeted list, it registers a button event handler.
* When the submit button is pressed, the extension extracts all data from all form fields through the Document Object Model interface in the browser, & remember the values.
* The extension modifies the values through the DOM interface. 
* The extension tells the browser to continue to submit the form to the server.
* The browser sends the form, including the modified values, to the server.
* The server receives the modified values in the form of a normal request.
* The server cannot differentiate between the original values, or detect the changes.
* The server performs the transaction & generates a receipt.
* The browser receives the receipt for the modified transaction.
* The extension detects the URL, scans the HTML for the receipt fields, & replaces the modified data in the receipt with the original data that it remembered in the HTML. 
* The browser displays the modified receipt with the original details.
* The user thinks that the original transaction was received by the server & authorized correctly.




Who this affects most: This attack is considered the greatest threat to online banking.


Mitigation: 
* Some attacks can be mitigated by using an out-of-band transaction verification.
* Trojans may be detected & removed by an antivirus software.
* User account management: check for privilege escalation vulnerability, restricting user permissions, and look for bypass user account control opportunities.
* Monitoring browser applications for process injections.
