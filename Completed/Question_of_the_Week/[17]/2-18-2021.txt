What are Blackholing and DNS Sinkholing, the advantage/disadvantage of both, and how are these performed?

Blackholing, a.k.a. DDoS blackhole routing/filtering, is a countermeasure mitigation tactic for a DDoS attack, when an organization has no other options of blocking an attack. This works by redirecting the network traffic into a “black hole”, and is lost. A black hole is a place where packets are dropped or destroyed, and no information is sent back to the source about the dropped packets, i.e packets are sent to a disconnected router. This can be useful if the target of an attack is a small site, connected to a larger network. Though it is an option for mitigation of an attack, the consequences could be serious. Blackhole filtering, without specific restriction criteria, sends both legitimate and malicious network traffic to a blackhole or a null route, and then dropped from the network. This indiscriminate disruption of traffic to the network may even be less effective when an attack uses variable IP addresses. The real downside is that good traffic is also affected, essentially completing the goal of the attacker to disrupt traffic to the target network, but in a different way. Some other downsides include:
* Blackholing must be carried out until the DDoS attack is over. This means it could take from hours to months.
* When an attack happens using IP address spoofing, blackholing can become useless.


DNS sinkhole is used to detect and prevent DOS attacks and malicious activity by spoofing the DNS servers, intercepting the DNS request, and preventing the resolving of host names of specified URLs. Sinkholing is a way of redirecting malicious traffic from the internet to be captured and analyzed. This is done by using a DNS forwarder that is configured to return a false IP address to a specified URL. It is very inexpensive to set up and maintain, but even more so if it is installed on a virtual platform, and it is very effective and highly scalable. The DNS sinkhole technique also makes it possible to deny access to any website. On an enterprise level, the sinkhole can be used to control the C&C, and other malicious traffic, to malicious URLs by entering a fake entry, gathered from an already known C&C server, in the DNS. A sinkhole is used when most of a system is almost completely compromised. One downside to using a DNS sinkhole is that in order for the sinkhole to block a malware or its traffic, it is required by the malware to use the organizations DNS server because a malware with its own hardcoded DNS server and IP address cannot be detected by the DNS sinkholing mechanism. Some other drawbacks include:
* A sinkhole cannot prevent malware from executing, spreading to other computers, or from being removed from an infected machine.
* If the sinkhole is not isolated from the external network, the attacker could be informed that the C&C traffic has been mitigated, and can manipulate the entries in the DNS sinkhole for malicious purposes.
