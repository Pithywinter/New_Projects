What is COBIT 2019, what makes this version different from its predecessors, and how is it compared to ITIL?


Developed by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), COBIT 2019 is categorized as an enterprise information and technology governance and management framework, and maintains a distinction from a IT service management approach. COBIT stands for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology. COBIT 5 improved upon the criticisms of the previous versions, because of the passing-of-tasks-down-the-line behavior that could be produced by COBIT practices. COBIT 5 suggested more rote rules and documentation for a more holistic and integrated governance. COBIT 2019 is more considered an umbrella, open-source-like framework that focuses on the enterprises needs, specifically the design factor of allowing enterprises of any size to create their own customized governance mechanism. 


Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a best practices framework that focuses on IT service staying relevant to the businesses needs. While COBIT 5 and previous versions are more of a top-down strategy for governance only, and ITIL is more of a bottom-up strategy that focuses on the management of IT services.
